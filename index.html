    <h2>Attack</h2>
    <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p>
    <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
    <h2>Eyesight</h2>
    <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other.They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p>
    <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light, and color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
